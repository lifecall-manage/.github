HRV-Based Health Scoring System with Wearable Integration

## What We Do

There are many indicators of HRV (Heart Rate Variablity), reflecting both physical and mental health. But it is hard to cross comparing these indicators given that they do not share the same scales:
Lifecall health watch integrates 72 HRV parameters into a unified assessment, providing a quantitative evaluation of physical and mental health every 3 minutes

## What Have We Done So Far

We are having partnerships with: Sun Yat-sen University Cancer CenterChina Academy of Chinese Medical SciencesSouth China Normal UniversityAlong with:5,803 watches sold, with 6,874 users. 

## Case Study

Each of the 72 parameters is integrated into a single health metric:Representing the physical and mental health status

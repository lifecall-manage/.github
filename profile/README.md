By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology and established psychological theories, we offer users a unique opportunity to engage with their core selves, discover their life's meanings, and foster a sense of belonging.

## Project Architecture

LifeCall is built on a robust and interconnected architecture that includes smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), AI services, and more. Here's an overview of our project architecture:

### 1. NFT and Game Smart Contracts
The [LifeCall NFT and Game Smart Contracts](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/life-contract) repository houses our smart contracts for gaming projects. These contracts interact with our core server (`life-core-server`) and decentralized app (`life-dapp`), facilitating data contributions and rewards.

### 2. DAO Smart Contracts
Our [DAO Smart Contracts](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/life-contract-dao) repository is responsible for decentralized autonomous organization functionalities. These smart contracts also interact with the `life-core-server` and `life-dapp` to enable seamless governance processes.

### 3. Algorithm Projects
The [LifeCall Algorithm Projects](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/life-patent) repository provides the core emotional algorithms that interact with our core server, `life-core-server`, enhancing our platform's analytical capabilities.

### 4. API Server Project
The [API Server Project](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/life-core-server) acts as the backbone of LifeCall, interfacing with `life-dapp`, `life-contract`, `life-contract-dao`, and `life-patent` to deliver essential API services across the platform.

### 5. AI Projects
Our [AI Projects](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/ai-coach) repository leverages custom large-scale models to provide AI-driven coaching and consultation, enhancing user interaction and personal growth.

### 6. dApp Frontend
The [dApp Frontend](https://github.com/lifecall-manage/life-dapp) repository facilitates user interaction with our smart contracts (`life-contract` and `life-contract-dao`) and core server (`life-core-server`), delivering a comprehensive and engaging user experience.

This architecture ensures a smooth interaction across different layers and components of the LifeCall platform, providing a seamless and enriching experience for users as they embark on their journey of self-discovery.
